## 📊 Algorithm Details

### Collaborative Filtering

**User-Based Algorithm**:
1. Build user-item interaction matrix
2. Calculate cosine similarity between users
3. Find top 5 similar users
4. Aggregate product scores from similar users
5. Weight by similarity and interaction scores
6. Filter out already interacted products
7. Return top N recommendations

**Item-Based Algorithm**:
1. Build user-item interaction matrix
2. Calculate cosine similarity between items (transpose)
3. For each user-interacted product
4. Find similar products
5. Weight by similarity and user interaction
6. Aggregate scores across all interacted products
7. Return top N recommendations

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Combines user-based (60%) and item-based (40%)
- Requests 2x items from each method
- Merges scores with weights
- Sorts by combined score

### Content-Based Filtering

**Feature Extraction**:
```python
Features = [
    OneHot(category) * 0.4 +
    MinMax(price) * 0.2 +
    TfidfVectorizer(tags, max_features=100) * 0.4
]
```

**Similarity Calculation**:
- Cosine similarity on weighted feature vectors
- Matrix pre-computation for efficiency
- O(1) lookup after training

**Recommendation Algorithm**:
1. Get user's interaction history
2. For each interacted product:
   - Find top K similar products
   - Weight by user's interaction score
3. Aggregate weighted similarity scores
4. Exclude already interacted products
5. Return top N by score

### Hybrid Service

**Combination Formula**:
```
hybrid_score = (
    normalize(collaborative_score) * 0.6 +
    normalize(content_score) * 0.4
)
```

**Business Rules Application**:
```
final_score = hybrid_score * category_boost * diversity_penalty

where:
  category_boost ∈ {1.0, 1.3}
  diversity_penalty ∈ {0.8, 1.0}
```

category_boost_factor = 1.3      # Multiplier for preferred categories
max_products_per_category = 2     # Diversity constraint
diversity_penalty = 0.8           # Penalty for exceeding limit
```

### Feature Weights (Content-Based)
```python
category_weight = 0.4  # Category feature importance
price_weight = 0.2     # Price feature importance
tags_weight = 0.4      # Tags feature importance
